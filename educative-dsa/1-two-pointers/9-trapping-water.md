# Trapping Rain Water

Given a sequence of non-negative integers representing the heights of bars in an elevation map, the goal is to determine the amount of rainwater that can be trapped between the bars after rain.

**Constraints**:

- - 0 ≤ `heights[i]` ≤ 10<sup>3</sup>
- - 1 ≤ `len(heights)` ≤ 10<sup>3</sup>
