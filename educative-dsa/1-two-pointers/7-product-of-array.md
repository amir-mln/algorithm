# Product of Array Except Self

You’re given an integer array, `arr`. Return a resultant array so that `res[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `arr` except `arr[i]`.

Write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time without using the division operation.

**Constraints:**

- 2 ≤ `len(arr)` ≤ 10<sup>3</sup>
- −30 ≤ `arr[i]` ≤ 30
- The product of any prefix or suffix of arr is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
