# Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Given a sorted integer array, `nums`, and an integer value, `target`, the array is rotated by some arbitrary number. Search and return the index of target in this array. If the target does not exist, return -1.

**Constraints**:

- All values in `nums` are unique.
- The values in `nums` are sorted in ascending order.
- The array may have been rotated by some arbitrary number.
- 1 ≤ `len(nums)` ≤ 1000
- -10<sup>4</sup> ≤ `nums[i]` ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>
- -10<sup>4</sup> ≤ `target` ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>
