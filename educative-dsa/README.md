# Educative Data Structures & Algorithm

This folder contains `Go` code for the [Educative.io](https://educative.io) data structures and algorithm courses. The three courses that I've taken are:

1. [Educative-99 in Go: Accelerate Your Coding Interview Prep](https://www.educative.io/path/educative-99-in-go-accelerate-your-coding-interview-prep)
2. [Grokking Grind 75 in Go: Mastery through Coding Patterns](https://www.educative.io/path/grokking-grind-75-in-go-mastery-through-coding-patterns)
3. [Grokking Blind 75 in Go: Mastery through Coding Patterns](https://www.educative.io/path/grokking-blind-75-in-go-mastery-through-coding-patterns)

Now I better make a little bit of a disclaimer; Overall, Theses courses overlap a lot with each other. And when combined, they make up to 11 modules and 166 question in total.
