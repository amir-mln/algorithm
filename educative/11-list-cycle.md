# Linked List Cycle

Check whether or not a linked list contains a cycle. If a cycle exists, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`. The cycle means that at least one node can be reached again by traversing the next pointer.

**Constraints**:

- 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 500 (`n` is the number of nodes in the list)
- -10<sup>5</sup> ≤ `Node.data` ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>
