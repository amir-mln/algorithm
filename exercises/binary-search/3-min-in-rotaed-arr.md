# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

You’re given a rotated sorted array, `nums`, of length `𝑛`, that is rotated clockwise between
`1` and `𝑛` times.

For example,

- Before rotation, `nums` is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].
- After 3 rotations, the `nums` becomes [6,7,8,1,2,3,4,5].

For the given array, your task is to find the minimum element of this array.

**Constraints**:

- 1≤n≤1000
- −5000 ≤ `nums[i]`≤ 5000
- All the elements of the array are distinct, that is, there are no duplicate elements.
